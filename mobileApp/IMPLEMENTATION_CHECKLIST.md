Run these SQL queries:

ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC;
```
- [ ] Order exists in database

```sql
-- Check order items
SELECT 
    oi.*, p.Name as ProductName
FROM OrderItems oi
JOIN Products p ON oi.ProductId = p.Id
WHERE oi.OrderId = (SELECT TOP 1 Id FROM Orders ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC);
```
- [ ] OrderItems records created

SELECT Id, Name, StockQuantity
FROM Products
WHERE Id IN (
    SELECT ProductId FROM OrderItems 
    WHERE OrderId = (SELECT TOP 1 Id FROM Orders ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC)
);
```
- [ ] Product stock quantities reduced
- [ ] Reduction matches order quantities

```sql
-- Check inventory transactions
SELECT *
FROM InventoryTransactions
WHERE OrderId = (SELECT TOP 1 Id FROM Orders ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC);
```
- [ ] InventoryTransaction records created
- [ ] Quantities are negative (sales)
- [ ] StockBefore and StockAfter are correct

### Test 3: Backend Verification

```
âœ… ðŸš€ API Request: POST /api/orders
âœ… Creating order with data: {...}
âœ… âœ… API Response: 201 /api/orders
âœ… Order created successfully: {orderId: X, orderNumber: "ORD..."}
âœ… ðŸš€ API Request: POST /api/orders/X/payments
âœ… âœ… API Response: 200 /api/orders/X/payments
âœ… Payment processed successfully
```

**Backend Console Should Show:**
```
âœ… POST /api/orders - 201 Created
âœ… POST /api/orders/{id}/payments - 200 OK
```

}
```

### Expected Payment Response:
```json
{

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "User not authenticated"
**Solution:**
```
1. Log out of mobile app
2. Log back in
3. Try again
```

### Issue: "User not associated with a store"
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Assign user to store
UPDATE Users 
SET StoreId = 1 
WHERE Id = [YourUserId];
```

### Issue: "No active shift"
**Note:** This is OK - orders can be created without shifts
The backend handles this gracefully

### Issue: Order created but payment fails
**Note:** This is acceptable behavior
- Order is saved
- Can process payment later in POS
- Not critical for mobile orders

### Issue: "Product not found"
**Solution:**
```
1. Check Products table has products
2. Verify product IDs in cart match database
3. Clear app cache and reload products
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Emergency Revert:**

   ```

2. **Restore Old Code:**
   - CheckoutScreen.tsx: Revert to setTimeout simulation
   - Add warning banner: "Orders temporarily disabled"

3. **Database Check:**
   ```sql
   -- Check for orphaned records
   SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Status = 'Pending';
   SELECT * FROM OrderItems WHERE OrderId NOT IN (SELECT Id FROM Orders);
   ```
