# BUILD ERROR FIX GUIDE

## Problem
You're experiencing a JavaScript compilation error: "Non-js exception: Compiling JS failed"

This error typically occurs due to:
- Corrupted Metro bundler cache
- Corrupted build files
- Stale dependencies
- Temporary files interfering with the build

## Solution

### OPTION 1: Quick Fix (Try this first)
1. Run the `fix-build.bat` script:
   ```
   fix-build.bat
   ```

2. In a NEW terminal, run:
   ```
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

### OPTION 2: Complete Fix (If Quick Fix doesn't work)
1. Run the `complete-fix.bat` script:
   ```
   complete-fix.bat
   ```
   *Note: This will take 5-10 minutes as it reinstalls all dependencies*

2. After completion, run:
   ```
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

### OPTION 3: Manual Fix (Step by step)
If the batch scripts don't work, follow these manual steps:

1. **Stop Metro Bundler**
   - Close any terminal running Metro bundler
   - Or press Ctrl+C in the Metro terminal

2. **Clean Metro Cache**
   ```
   npx react-native start --reset-cache
   ```
   Press Ctrl+C to stop after it starts

3. **Clean Android Build**
   ```
   cd android
   gradlew clean
   cd ..
   ```

4. **Remove Build Folders**
   ```
   rmdir /s /q android\app\build
   rmdir /s /q android\build
   ```

5. **Clear Node Cache**
   ```
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

6. **Reinstall Node Modules** (only if other steps don't work)
   ```
   rmdir /s /q node_modules
   npm install
   ```

7. **Start Fresh**
   Open two terminals:
   
   Terminal 1:
   ```
   npx react-native start --reset-cache
   ```
   
   Terminal 2 (after Metro starts):
   ```
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

## What I Fixed

I reviewed all your source code files and found no syntax errors. The files are all correct:
- ✅ App.tsx
- ✅ All screen components
- ✅ All Redux slices
- ✅ All API files
- ✅ Navigation setup
- ✅ Store configuration

The error is in the BUNDLED JavaScript (the compiled output), not in your source code.

## Why This Happens

React Native's Metro bundler compiles your TypeScript/JavaScript files into a single bundle. 
Sometimes this bundle gets corrupted due to:
- Interrupted builds
- File changes while Metro is running
- Cache inconsistencies
- Temporary file system issues

## Prevention

To avoid this in the future:
1. Always stop Metro before pulling new code
2. Clean cache after switching branches
3. Don't edit files while the app is building
4. Restart Metro if you see warnings

## Still Having Issues?

If none of these work:
1. Check that your Android emulator is running
2. Make sure no other Metro process is running:
   ```
   taskkill /F /IM node.exe
   ```
3. Try restarting your computer (clears all system caches)
4. Check the full error log in the terminal for more details

## Files Created

I created these helper scripts for you:
- `fix-build.bat` - Quick cache clean and restart
- `complete-fix.bat` - Full clean including node_modules

Run these whenever you encounter build errors!
