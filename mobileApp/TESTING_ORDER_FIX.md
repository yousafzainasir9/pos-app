âœ… âœ… API Response: 201 /api/orders
âœ… Payment processed successfully
```

### In Backend:
1. Open Visual Studio
2. Check Output window for:
```
âœ… POST /api/orders - 201 Created
âœ… POST /api/orders/{id}/payments - 200 OK
```

### In Database:
Run this SQL query:
```sql
-- Check latest order
SELECT TOP 1 
    Id,
    OrderNumber,
    CustomerName,
    TotalAmount,
    Status,
    OrderDate,
    CreatedAt
FROM Orders 
ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC;

-- Check order items
SELECT 
    oi.Id,
    oi.OrderId,
    p.Name as ProductName,
    oi.Quantity,
    oi.TotalAmount
FROM OrderItems oi
JOIN Products p ON oi.ProductId = p.Id
WHERE oi.OrderId = (SELECT TOP 1 Id FROM Orders ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC);

-- Check payment
SELECT TOP 1 
    Id,
    OrderId,
    Amount,
    PaymentMethod,
    Status,
    PaymentDate
FROM Payments 
ORDER BY PaymentDate DESC;
```

```

If `OrdersLast5Min` > 0, **it worked!** ðŸŽ‰
