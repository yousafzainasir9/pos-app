## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Always check Metro bundler output** - errors appear there first
2. **Use Android Studio Logcat** - shows native crashes
3. **Clear cache when in doubt** - `npm start -- --reset-cache`
4. **Restart emulator** - sometimes it's just stuck
5. **Check file paths** - Windows uses backslashes
6. **One change at a time** - easier to debug
7. **Read error messages carefully** - they usually tell you what's wrong

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Getting Help

When reporting issues, provide:

1. **Exact error message** - copy/paste from terminal
2. **What you tried** - what steps you've taken
3. **Your environment** - OS, Node version, React Native version
4. **When it happens** - during build, runtime, etc.
5. **Screenshots** - if applicable

**Example:**
```
Error: Unable to resolve module `react-redux`
Environment: Windows 11, Node 18.0.0, RN 0.73
Tried: npm install, clearing cache
Happens: During Metro bundler start
```

This helps diagnose the issue faster!

**Remember:** Most issues are fixable with a clean cache and rebuild. Don't give up! ðŸš€
