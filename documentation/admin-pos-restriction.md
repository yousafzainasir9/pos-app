# Admin POS Access Restriction - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented role-based access control to prevent Admin users from accessing the POS system and cart functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Components Created

#### `RoleBasedRoute.tsx`
- **Location**: `frontend/src/components/auth/RoleBasedRoute.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Wrapper component that restricts route access based on user roles
- **Features**:
  - Checks if user is authenticated
  - Validates if user's role is in the allowed roles list
  - Shows "Access Denied" message if unauthorized
  - Automatically redirects unauthenticated users to login

#### `HomeRedirect.tsx`
- **Location**: `frontend/src/components/auth/HomeRedirect.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Smart home page redirect based on user role
- **Logic**:
  - Admin users → redirected to `/admin`
  - Other users (Manager, Cashier, Staff) → redirected to `/pos`

### 2. Updated Files

#### `App.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Imported `RoleBasedRoute` and `HomeRedirect` components
- Protected `/pos` route - only accessible by Manager, Cashier, and Staff
- Protected `/cart` route - only accessible by Manager, Cashier, and Staff
- Updated root route (`/`) to use `HomeRedirect` for smart role-based navigation

**Route Protection**:
```tsx
<Route path="/pos" element={
  <Layout>
    <RoleBasedRoute allowedRoles={['Manager', 'Cashier', 'Staff']}>
      <POSPage />
    </RoleBasedRoute>
  </Layout>
} />
```

#### `Header.tsx`
**Changes**:
1. **POS Navigation Link**: Hidden for Admin users
2. **Cart Icon**: Hidden for Admin users (including badge with item count)
3. **Shift Status Badge**: Hidden for Admin users

**Conditional Rendering Logic**:
```tsx
{user?.role !== 'Admin' && (
  // POS-related UI elements
)}
```

## User Experience

### Admin Users
- **Cannot see**: POS link, Cart icon, Shift status badge
- **Can see**: Orders, Products, Reports, Admin links
- **Default landing**: `/admin` page
- **Attempting to access POS**: Shows "Access Denied" message with current role information

### Manager/Cashier/Staff Users
- **Can see**: All navigation including POS, Cart, Shift status
- **Default landing**: `/pos` page
- **Full access**: To POS system and cart functionality

## Security Features

1. **Route Protection**: Backend routes should also validate roles (middleware)
2. **UI Restrictions**: Hidden navigation prevents accidental access
3. **Access Denied Page**: Clear feedback when unauthorized access attempted
4. **Role Verification**: Checked at multiple levels (routing, component rendering)

## Testing Checklist

### As Admin User
- [ ] Login redirects to `/admin` page
- [ ] POS link not visible in navigation
- [ ] Cart icon not visible in header
- [ ] Shift status badge not visible
- [ ] Direct navigation to `/pos` shows "Access Denied"
- [ ] Direct navigation to `/cart` shows "Access Denied"
- [ ] Can access: Orders, Products, Reports, Admin pages

### As Manager/Cashier User
- [ ] Login redirects to `/pos` page
- [ ] POS link visible and functional
- [ ] Cart icon visible with badge
- [ ] Shift status badge visible
- [ ] Can access all POS functionality
- [ ] Can view and manage orders

## Backend Recommendations

To complete the security implementation, ensure backend API endpoints also validate user roles:

```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "Manager,Cashier,Staff")]
[HttpPost("orders")]
public async Task<IActionResult> CreateOrder([FromBody] CreateOrderRequest request)
{
    // Implementation
}
```

## Notes

- Admin users retain full access to viewing orders, products, and reports
- This restriction only applies to the POS transaction interface
- Shift management is also restricted from Admin view as it's operational
- The restriction is both visual (UI) and functional (routing)
