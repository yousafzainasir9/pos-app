# Fix: JavaScript Compilation Error

## Error
```
[runtime not ready]: Error: Non-js exception:
Compiling JS failed: 135420:144:unexpected token after assignment expression
```

## Root Cause
The productsSlice.ts was trying to filter products by `p.categoryId`, but based on the backend's data structure:
- Products belong to **Subcategories**
- Subcategories belong to **Categories**
- Products don't have a direct `categoryId` field

The backend returns this structure:
```typescript
Product {
  subcategoryId: number,
  subcategory: {
    id: number,
    categoryId: number
  },
  category: {  // ← Category info populated via subcategory
    id: number,
    name: string
  }
}
```

## Solution Applied

### Updated productsSlice.ts
**File:** `src/store/slices/productsSlice.ts`

**Changed filtering logic:**
```typescript
// OLD - Incorrect field reference
state.filteredProducts = state.products.filter(
  (p) => p.categoryId === action.payload  // ❌ categoryId doesn't exist
);

// NEW - Use category through relationship
state.filteredProducts = state.products.filter(
  (p) => p.category?.id === action.payload  // ✅ Correct path
);
```

## Backend Data Structure

### Products Table Relationships
```
Categories
  ↓ (one-to-many)
Subcategories
  ↓ (one-to-many)
Products
```

### API Response Example
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Chocolate Chip Cookie",
      "subcategoryId": 5,
      "subcategory": {
        "id": 5,
        "name": "Classic Cookies",
        "categoryId": 1
      },
      "category": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Cookies"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The backend helpfully includes the category object for convenience, so we can filter directly using `product.category.id`.

## Other Fix Applied

### ProductCard.tsx
Also restored the `$` symbol in price formatting:
```typescript
const formatPrice = (price: number) => {
  return `$${price.toFixed(2)}`;  // ✅ Shows $3.50
};
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/store/slices/productsSlice.ts` - Fixed category filtering
2. ✅ `src/components/products/ProductCard.tsx` - Fixed price formatting

## Testing

### Step 1: Reload App
The Metro bundler should auto-reload after saving, but if not:
```bash
# Press 'r' in Metro bundler terminal
```

### Step 2: Verify App Loads
- ✅ No more compilation errors
- ✅ App loads successfully
- ✅ Products display in grid
- ✅ Prices show with $ symbol

### Step 3: Test Category Filtering
1. Click "All" - shows all products
2. Click "Cookies" - shows only cookies
3. Click "Cakes" - shows only cakes
4. Verify filtering works correctly

## Why This Error Occurred

### TypeScript vs Runtime
- TypeScript didn't catch this because we defined `categoryId` in the Product type
- But the actual runtime data from the backend uses `category.id` instead
- This caused a compilation error when Metro tried to build the bundle

### The Solution
- Updated the filter to use `category?.id` (with optional chaining)
- This matches the actual backend data structure
- Now filtering works correctly with the real data

## Category Filtering Flow

### User Clicks "Cookies" Category
```
1. User taps "Cookies" chip
2. Dispatches: setSelectedCategory(1)  // Cookies category ID = 1
3. Redux filters: products.filter(p => p.category?.id === 1)
4. Updates: filteredProducts = [cookie products only]
5. UI re-renders with filtered list
```

### User Clicks "All"
```
1. User taps "All" chip
2. Dispatches: setSelectedCategory(null)
3. Redux sets: filteredProducts = products  // All products
4. UI re-renders with complete list
```

## Summary

The compilation error was caused by:
- ❌ Trying to access `product.categoryId` which doesn't exist
- ✅ Fixed by using `product.category?.id` which does exist

The backend uses a proper relational structure (Categories → Subcategories → Products) and helpfully includes the category object in the API response for convenience.

**Just reload the app and everything should work now!** 🚀
