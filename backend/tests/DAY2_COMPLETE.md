# Day 2: Infrastructure Tests Complete ✅

## What We've Accomplished Today

### ✅ Repository Query Tests (14 tests)
**File:** `RepositoryQueryTests.cs`

Advanced query operations tested:
- ✅ Query with no filters returns all active products
- ✅ Query with WHERE clause filters correctly
- ✅ Query with Include loads navigation properties
- ✅ Query with Include + ThenInclude loads nested properties
- ✅ Query with OrderBy sorts ascending
- ✅ Query with OrderByDescending sorts descending
- ✅ Query with Skip and Take paginates correctly
- ✅ Query with complex filters returns matching results
- ✅ Query with Select projects results
- ✅ Query with Count returns correct count
- ✅ Query with FirstOrDefaultAsync returns first match
- ✅ Query with AnyAsync checks existence
- ✅ Query with GroupBy groups results
- ✅ Query with multiple Includes loads all navigation properties

### ✅ UnitOfWork Tests (10 tests)
**File:** `UnitOfWorkTests.cs`

Transaction management tested:
- ✅ Repository returns same instance for same type (caching)
- ✅ Repository returns different instances for different types
- ✅ SaveChangesAsync with added entity persists to database
- ✅ SaveChangesAsync with multiple changes persists all
- ✅ BeginTransaction starts transaction successfully
- ✅ CommitTransaction with changes persists all
- ✅ RollbackTransaction reverts changes
- ✅ Multiple repositories share same context
- ✅ SaveChangesAsync with no changes returns zero
- ✅ Transaction with multiple operations works correctly

### ✅ Soft Delete Tests (16 tests)
**File:** `SoftDeleteTests.cs`

Soft delete behavior verified:
- ✅ Remove sets IsDeleted to true
- ✅ Remove sets DeletedOn timestamp
- ✅ Query doesn't return deleted entities
- ✅ GetByIdAsync returns null for deleted entity
- ✅ GetAllAsync doesn't include deleted entities
- ✅ IgnoreQueryFilters returns deleted entities
- ✅ Multiple deletes all soft deleted correctly
- ✅ Soft delete doesn't affect other entities
- ✅ Category delete is soft deleted
- ✅ Update after soft delete not visible in queries
- ✅ Count doesn't include deleted entities
- ✅ Any doesn't include deleted entities
- ✅ FirstOrDefault doesn't return deleted entity
- ✅ Include with deleted navigation property handles correctly

### ✅ SecurityService Tests (20 tests)
**File:** `SecurityServiceTests.cs`

Token generation and hashing tested:
- ✅ GenerateSecureToken returns non-empty string
- ✅ GenerateSecureToken with different sizes returns different lengths
- ✅ GenerateSecureToken multiple calls return different tokens
- ✅ GenerateSecureToken with zero size returns empty string
- ✅ GenerateSecureToken with large size succeeds
- ✅ HashToken returns non-empty hash
- ✅ HashToken with same input returns same hash (deterministic)
- ✅ HashToken with different input returns different hash
- ✅ HashToken with empty string returns hash
- ✅ HashToken with long string returns fixed length hash
- ✅ HashToken SHA256 produces correct length (64 chars)
- ✅ HashToken produces hexadecimal string
- ✅ HashToken is case sensitive
- ✅ HashToken with special characters handles correctly
- ✅ GenerateSecureToken is URL-safe (no +, /, =)
- ✅ Full workflow (generate and hash) works correctly
- ✅ HashToken with null throws exception
- ✅ GenerateSecureToken with negative size throws or returns empty

## How to Run Day 2 Tests

### Run All Infrastructure Tests
```bash
cd D:\pos-app\backend
dotnet test tests/POS.Infrastructure.Tests
```

### Run Specific Test Files
```bash
# Repository query tests
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~RepositoryQueryTests"

# UnitOfWork tests
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~UnitOfWorkTests"

# Soft delete tests
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~SoftDeleteTests"

# Security service tests
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~SecurityServiceTests"
```

### Run with Coverage
```bash
dotnet test tests/POS.Infrastructure.Tests --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

## Team Notes

The infrastructure layer is now solidly tested with 60 new tests covering:
- All repository operations (basic and advanced)
- Transaction management and coordination
- Soft delete behavior across all scenarios
- Security token generation and hashing

The foundation is strong, and we're on track to meet our 170+ test goal by Day 10! 

**Progress: 40% complete (69/170 tests)** 📊

Next up: Service layer tests for business logic validation! 💪
