# ⚡ Quick Start - Exact Steps in Order

## 🎯 Current Status Check

I see you have:
- ✅ `node_modules` folder (you ran npm install)
- ✅ `src` folder with all our code
- ❌ `android` folder (MISSING - needed for React Native)
- ❌ `ios` folder (MISSING - needed for React Native)

**Problem:** You need to initialize the React Native project first to get the android/ios folders!

---

## 📋 Follow These Steps EXACTLY

### Step 1️⃣: Go to Parent Directory

```bash
cd D:\pos-app
```

### Step 2️⃣: Rename Current Folder (Backup)

```bash
rename CookieBarrelMobile CookieBarrelMobile_backup
```

This keeps all the files we created safe.

### Step 3️⃣: Create NEW React Native Project

```bash
npx react-native@latest init CookieBarrelMobile --template react-native-template-typescript
```

**⏱️ This takes 5-10 minutes.** Wait for it to complete!

You'll see lots of output. Wait for:
```
✔ All done!
```

### Step 4️⃣: Copy Our Files Back

```bash
# Copy src folder
xcopy CookieBarrelMobile_backup\src CookieBarrelMobile\src /E /I /Y

# Copy documentation
copy CookieBarrelMobile_backup\*.md CookieBarrelMobile\
copy CookieBarrelMobile_backup\*.bat CookieBarrelMobile\
```

### Step 5️⃣: Go Into New Project

```bash
cd CookieBarrelMobile
```

### Step 6️⃣: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/bottom-tabs @react-navigation/native-stack react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux axios @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-paper react-native-vector-icons date-fns
```

### Step 7️⃣: Configure Vector Icons

**Edit file:** `android\app\build.gradle`

**Add this line at the BOTTOM:**

```gradle
apply from: "../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/fonts.gradle"
```

See `VECTOR_ICONS_SETUP.md` for detailed help.

### Step 8️⃣: Update index.js

**Edit file:** `index.js` (in root folder)

**Change this:**
```javascript
import App from './App';
```

**To this:**
```javascript
import App from './src/App';
```

**Full file should be:**
```javascript
import {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';
import App from './src/App';
import {name as appName} from './app.json';

AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
```

### Step 9️⃣: Configure API URL (Optional for now)

**Edit file:** `src\api\client.ts`

**For Android Emulator (default):**
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://10.0.2.2:5000/api';
```

**For Physical Device:**
1. Run `ipconfig` in CMD
2. Find your IPv4 Address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
3. Update to: `const API_BASE_URL = 'http://192.168.1.100:5000/api';`

### Step 🔟: Run the App!

**Option A: Use Batch File**
```bash
run-android.bat
```

**Option B: Manual (2 terminals)**

Terminal 1:
```bash
npm start
```

Terminal 2:
```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

## ✅ Success Checklist

You'll know it worked when you see:

- [ ] Metro bundler starts (Terminal 1)
- [ ] Build succeeds (Terminal 2)
- [ ] App installs on emulator/device
- [ ] Login screen appears
- [ ] "Continue as Guest" button visible
- [ ] After clicking: 3 tabs appear at bottom
- [ ] Icons show correctly (not boxes)
- [ ] Can switch between tabs
- [ ] No red error screen

---

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### "Cannot find module"
```bash
npm install
```

### Build fails
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
npx react-native run-android
```

### Icons are boxes
```bash
# Make sure you added the gradle line!
# Then clean and rebuild:
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
npx react-native run-android
```

### Metro bundler issues
```bash
npm start -- --reset-cache
```

## 🎯 Time Estimate

- Steps 1-3: 10 minutes (React Native init is slow)
- Steps 4-6: 5 minutes
- Steps 7-8: 2 minutes
- Step 9: 2 minutes
- Step 10: 5 minutes (first build is slow)

**Total: ~25 minutes**

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Don't skip Step 3** - You MUST run React Native init
2. **Wait for Step 3 to complete** - Don't interrupt it
3. **Copy files in Step 4** - Don't forget this!
4. **Double-check Step 7** - Vector icons config is crucial
5. **Use batch files** - Easier than typing commands
