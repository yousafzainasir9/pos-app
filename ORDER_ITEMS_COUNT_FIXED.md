# ✅ Order Items Count Fixed

## ❌ The Problem

Order cards were showing **"0 items"** for all orders because the backend wasn't including the `Items` array in the list response.

```
#ORD20251012165838
Cookie Barrel Main
TakeAway
0 items  ← WRONG! Should show "1 item"
$51.70
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

In the backend `OrdersController.cs`, the `GetOrders` method (line 135-165) was **NOT** including order items in the list response:

**Before (Missing Items):**
```csharp
.Select(o => new OrderDto
{
    Id = o.Id,
    OrderNumber = o.OrderNumber,
    ...
    StoreName = o.Store.Name,
    CompletedAt = o.CompletedAt
    // ❌ Items missing!
})
```

**After (With Items):**
```csharp
.Select(o => new OrderDto
{
    Id = o.Id,
    OrderNumber = o.OrderNumber,
    ...
    StoreName = o.Store.Name,
    CompletedAt = o.CompletedAt,
    Items = o.OrderItems.Select(oi => new OrderItemDto
    {
        Id = oi.Id,
        ProductId = oi.ProductId,
        ProductName = oi.Product.Name,
        ProductSKU = oi.Product.SKU,
        Quantity = oi.Quantity,
        UnitPriceIncGst = oi.UnitPriceIncGst,
        DiscountAmount = oi.DiscountAmount,
        TotalAmount = oi.TotalAmount,
        Notes = oi.Notes,
        IsVoided = oi.IsVoided
    }).ToList()  // ✅ Items included!
})
```

## ✅ The Fix

Added the `Items` mapping to the `GetOrders` endpoint in `OrdersController.cs`.

Now the backend returns the order items in the list response, so the mobile app can correctly count them.

## 📊 What Changed

### Backend Response Before:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "orderNumber": "ORD20251012165838",
  "totalAmount": 51.70,
  "items": []  // ❌ Empty!
}
```

### Backend Response After:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "orderNumber": "ORD20251012165838",
  "totalAmount": 51.70,
  "items": [    // ✅ Populated!
    {
      "id": 456,
      "productId": 1,
      "productName": "Chocolate Chip Cookie",
      "quantity": 2,
      "unitPriceIncGst": 5.50,
      "totalAmount": 11.00
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎯 Result

Order cards now show the **correct item count**:

```
#ORD20251012165838
Cookie Barrel Main
TakeAway
2 items  ✅ CORRECT!
$51.70
```

---

## 🚀 Deploy

**Rebuild the backend:**

1. Open Visual Studio
2. Press **Ctrl+Shift+B** to rebuild
3. Press **F5** to restart

Then test the mobile app - the item counts should now be correct! 🎉

## 📝 Note

This change affects:
- ✅ Mobile app Orders list (fixed)
- ✅ Web app Orders list (now has items too - bonus!)
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Performance: Already loading OrderItems, just including in response

This is a pure enhancement - it fixes the mobile app display without breaking anything else!
