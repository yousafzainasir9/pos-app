## 🎯 What You Can Do Right Now

### As an Admin, you can:
1. ✅ Configure receipt appearance
2. ✅ Preview receipts in real-time
3. ✅ Set up email notifications
4. ✅ Test email configuration
5. ✅ Configure system defaults
6. ✅ Set password policies
7. ✅ Enable/disable POS features
8. ✅ Export all settings as backup
9. ✅ Import settings to restore
10. ✅ Reset everything to defaults

### What works perfectly:
- Receipt template with all options
- Email setup and testing
- Default values for entire system
- Export/Import for backups
- Reset to factory defaults
- Real-time validation
- Live preview

### What needs attention:
- Password should be encrypted (works but insecure)
- No audit trail yet (can't see who changed what)
- No caching (might be slow with many requests)

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### For Production Release:
- [x] All CRUD operations work
- [x] Admin-only access enforced
- [x] Settings persist correctly
- [x] Validation prevents bad data
- [x] UI is intuitive and responsive
- [x] Export/Import works
- [x] Email test works
- [ ] Passwords are encrypted (TODO)
